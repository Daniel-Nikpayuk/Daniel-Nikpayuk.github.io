        <p>
          I absolutely loved this book! It offered for me a much needed soft but detailed introduction into how
          the internet works. As a coder, as soon as you want to code anything that accesses the internet,
          understanding the content laid out in this book is essential.
        </p>

        <p>
          The major narrative in this book I would say is <em>transmission</em>. Building on this the main themes
          I would say are <em>what do we need to make transmission possible?</em> followed up with <em>how do we
          then go about making transmission possible?</em> To this end then, the plot ends up being a layer cake:
          Protocol layers of communication. The first two chapters deal with the ability to transmit, while the
          remainder deals with how best to transmit.

        <p>
          I found this text to be very logically organized, and just as importantly, it lets you see the technical
          details of how to build an internet but without boring you. As a reference, it offers enough of the landscape
          to get you started.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the application layer stuff is beginning to be dated, and the security and ethics are definitely
          dated given how much the world wide web has changed, but otherwise I found this book to be very relevant
          for any coder wanting to write apps that use the internet&mdash;which is pretty much everyone these days.

        <h3>Chapter 1 - Physical Layer</h3>

        <p>
          This chapter was interesting in the various transmission hardware it explained. Even in day to day life,
          society still offers many details about how our technologies work, but I find there's very little when
          it comes to the hardware infrastructure that makes the internet possible. I think I saw a TEDtalk once.
          That's about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I especially liked the engineering concepts introduced. I come from a math background, not an engineering
          background, so things like <strong>multiplexing</strong> I found conceptually fascinating!
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 2 - Data Link Layer</h3>

        <p>
          This chapter was more theoretical. Knowing the available hardware from the previous chapter, we're taken
          to looking at how to make transmissions across such hardware reliable. I enjoyed the practical considerations
          as this chapter still split up the discussion making good comparisons between physical and wireless connectivity.
          At the end of the day though, it was more about <strong>error correction</strong>, as well as sustainable
          transmission&mdash;which is to say smoothly paced and synchronous transmissions, for example.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 3 - Medium Access Control Layer</h3>

        <p>
          My favorite part of this chapter is finding out what MAC means, and how it applies to the internet. Mostly
          because everytime I booted up a computer when I was originally attending school, the screen always mentioned
          a "MAC Address" and I always wondered what that was, haha.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's exactly it though. With the potential of transmission discussed in the previous two chapters,
          we finally get to take a look at an actual end to end transmission. As this is an engineer's book,
          we mitigate complexity through <em>stratification</em>. This is the first layer beyond the physical,
          and is the simplest. This chapter focuses on local transmission from device to device within a single
          network, each device having its own identifiable MAC address.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 4 - Network Layer</h3>

        <p>
          The network layer is where things finally start coming together. It's the IP layer, the <em>Internet Protocol</em>.
          As a programmer, I've written a few applications which make use of the internet protocol. Mostly I was relying on libraries
          which had good enough documentation that I managed to succeed with my code, but I only kind of knew what I was doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not saying this is the preferred approach, but when you're self-taught it's also difficult sometimes to find
          comprehensive material to teach how an entire technology stack works. I am absolutely grateful to this book,
          and this chapter in particular as it illuminated so many words I had come across previously such as
          <strong>packets, routing, traffic, control, shaping, IPv4, IPv6</strong>. Many of these concepts I had intuitive
          understandings, enough to get by, but it's so much more satisfying to find something definitive.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Chapter 5 - Transport Layer</h3>

        <p>
          In a way, you can consider the network layer an explanation of the <em>capability of transmission</em>, as it
          laid down the IP infrastructure. In that case, the transport layer explores how to go about transmitting at this level
          of complexity. In particular, this is where one learns about things like <strong>sockets, connection establishments,
          connection releases, error correction</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other valuable knowledge this chapter introduces is that there are two transport layer protocols:
          <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) as well as <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong> (UDP).
          I never knew there were two ways to send a message across the internet.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="anchor" id="chapter_06"></div>

      <section>
        <h3>Chapter 6 - Application Layer</h3>

        <p>
          For me, the most useful part of this chapter was in understanding how the <strong>Domain Name System</strong>
          (DNS) works. I've run into the term, especially in learning to use linux, but it was kinda vague until now.
          I definitely found understanding this layer worthwhile, as it helped clarify to me how applications use
          <strong>ports</strong>, and how <strong>uniform resource locators (urls)</strong> actually work.
        </p>

        <p>
          So much of the internet is just done for us, we don't even question it, so it's nice to see the processes
          behind these things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="anchor" id="chapter_07"></div>

      <section>
        <h3>Chapter 7 - Security and Ethics</h3>

        <p>
          This was the one layer that didn't fit the narrative, or rather the <em>mitigation strategy</em>. In a way,
          security and ethics are orthogonal considerations, but I tend to agree with the general assessment given in
          this chapter that <strong>security needs to be interleaved</strong> within this layer cake, it needs to exist
          within each protocol in the technology stack. My only criticism&mdash;not just for this book but for this and so
          many others&mdash;is that security is always an after-thought. Then again, many of the books I've read were written
          long before this newer more dangerous internet. The threat vectors of the day were immature in comparison to what
          needs to be taken into account today.
