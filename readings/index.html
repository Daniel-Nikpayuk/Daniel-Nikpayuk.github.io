      <p>
        We don't take time to appreciate the books we've read. Every book you see in the stack (in the photo) I have either read
        entirely, or mostly. I have loved them all! I have certainly read other books as well over the years, but I either don't
        own them, am too embarrassed to admit I've read them, ahah, or they're in digital format.

      <p>
        I've decided to add book readings to this website. Some I read years ago, some I've read recently,
        but if they're up here at all it means I think they're worth talking about. Feel free to check back now and again
        as I will continue to add to this list. Please enjoy these reviews :)
