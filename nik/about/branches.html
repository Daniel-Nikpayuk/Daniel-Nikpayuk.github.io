      <p>
        The top down design of this library is such that it splits into branches. The names of these branches
        may be formal, but they are otherwise meant to represent abstractions of <em>hardware types</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following is a list of existing (as well as planned) branches for this library:
      </p>

      <section id="branch-table">

        <div>metaric</div>	<div>compile-time grammar</div>
        <div>grammaric</div>	<div>run-time grammar</div>
        <div>numeric</div>	<div>memory narrative</div>
        <div>graphic</div>	<div>screen narrative</div>
        <div>phonetic</div>	<div>soundcard narrative</div>
        <div>literic</div>	<div>keyboard narrative</div>
        <div>kinetic</div>	<div>mouse/touchpad narrative</div>
        <div>interic</div>	<div>internet narrative</div>

      <p>
        This library is intended to be a general purpose <em>prototyping</em> library.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although technically each hardware type is separate, one cannot have a computer or its program
        applications without interactivity (and relationships) between these types. As such, this library
        reflects this truth: The branches do depend on each other regardless. With that said, I have done
        my best to keep the narrative flow of these dependencies as axiomatic (fan-like) as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, even though this library is intended to be general purpose, I myself am interested in
        developing these branches towards a multimedia library to assist in Indigenous storytelling.
        In particular, this means focusing on typesetting modules, which beyond the general purpose core
        (<em>metaric, grammaric, numeric</em>), would narratively depend first on <em>graphics</em> to be
        able to render fonts, as well as <em>literics</em> to respond to the unicode relationships
        within a text.
