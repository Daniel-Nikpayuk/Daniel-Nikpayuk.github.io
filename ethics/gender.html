      <p>
        Feminism is the belief that there should be equality between genders in all aspects of society.
        When an unjust power dynamic does exist, the return to justice is three-fold:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Redesign cultural norms and expectations of gender to be fair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reallocate representation within the system to be balanced.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redistribute unearned privilege within the system to be just.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>&mdash;</p>

      <p>
        Technology isn't gender neutral. The intent we imbue upon it, the effects our interpretations of it have on society,
        not to mention the relational environments in which we develop it all factor into the equality between genders.
        As software engineers and developers we need to navigate and negotiate our technological uses and productions
        and be socially aware of how they can be made to undermine the rights that uphold gender equality.

      <h3>Just Privilege</h3>

      <p>
        Consent, boundaries.
        Just privilege requires equal treatment under the law, as well as equal access to the institutional services of society.
        Just privilege between genders is undermined when those who have inherited unjust privilege either don't question their
        privilege and its deleterious effects, or use their privilege to maintain unjust power dynamics between genders:

      <h3>Balanced Representation</h3>

      <p>
        Balanced representation between genders is undermined when raise profile, awareness, inclusion.
        Listen, voices, stories, perspectives.

        Furthermore, we need to make the time to learn the perspectives of others, so that we can better provide healthy work
        cultures and environments for all:

      <h3>Cultural Norms and Expectations</h3>

      <p>
        Behaviours, attitudes, Healthy relationships, friendships between equals, intimacy, entitlement.

        With the technology sector being male dominated, it has been well documented that many cultural norms and expectations
        within the tech industry already undermine gender equality. As such, one of the first steps us men can take in promoting
        justice is to interrogate our attitudes and behaviours, and to educate ourselves about
