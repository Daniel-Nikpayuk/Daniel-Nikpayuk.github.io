        Liberal democracy rests on three distinct sets of rights: property rights, political rights, and civil rights.
        The first set of rights protects owners and investors from expropriation. The second ensures that groups that
        win electoral contests can assume power and choose policies to their liking - provided these policies do not
        violate the other two sets of rights. Finally, civil rights guarantee equal treatment before the law and equal
        access to public services such as education.

        Technology isn't politically neutral. As software engineers and developers we need to be mindful about the
        potential misuses of the technologies we introduce into the world. In particular, we need to be socially
        aware of how they can be made to undermine the rights that uphold our societies.
      </p>

      <h3>Civil Rights</h3>

      <p>
        The social strategies used to maintain or extend existing civil rights (such as public protest) are often protected
        by the legal systems of our society. Even when such strategies are protected by law, there may still be other
        political factors which require discretion when implementing such strategies:

      <h3>Political Rights</h3>

      <p>
        Political rights can be undermined by attacking democratic transparency. Technology in particular has the capacity
        for scalability, which creates new forms of electoral obfuscation, along with introducing new gaps in electoral
        accountability:

      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Property Rights</h3>

        Property rights are undermined when it becomes untenable or impractical to enforce them. Enforcement becomes an
        issue when laws are unable to adapt to the pace of new technologies, or when a globally connected world allows
        for theft from otherwise disconnected legal jurisdictions:
