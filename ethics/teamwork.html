        More than any other relationship strategy, goal, approach, a <strong>culture of helpers</strong> is key to sustaining teamwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        The terminology of <em>a helper</em> I actually borrow from Adam Grant with his eye opening TEDtalk in which he asks:
        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker">Are you a giver or a taker?</a>
        This is not to say I was blindly convinced by a thirteen minute video on the merits of helper cultures,
        rather my various work experiences support and confirm his conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a manager at McDonald's for example, one of the most valuable expressions I learned was <em>Be Here Now</em>,
        which is to say: Don't lose sight of your current customers and your current team. Business comes from people&mdash;customers
        and coworkers&mdash;so take care of them first.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to this, as I've worked a few other places since then I've seen firsthand the practical value in
        <em>assuming innocence</em> by default, not to mention making sure to say <em>thank you</em> when your team helps you out.
        Otherwise, attitudes and behaviours of mistrust or lack of recognition tend to change peoples expecations of the team
        environment&mdash;ultimately weakening a culture of helpers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Create and maintain an environment that supports a helper culture, and you'll have a strong healthy team:
        <em>Morale</em> is just as important to a team environment as the product being made.
