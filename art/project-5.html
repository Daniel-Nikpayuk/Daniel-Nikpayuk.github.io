        It was nice to return back to painting. We were allowed to free form two paintings so long as they could
        be assembled afterward as a composable <strong>diptych</strong>. The other students really liked the one
        on the right, which was nice. I seem to have a gift for ambiguity. People said they saw a <em>monkey</em>,
        but if you turn it sideways they saw a <em>joker</em>.
