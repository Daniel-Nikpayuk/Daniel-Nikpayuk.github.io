      <p>
        This project we got to use conté, which if you don't know is like a kind of charcoal crayon.
        We were exploring different <strong>mediums for expressing art</strong>.

        The above is my second attempt. My first attempt turned out poorly, not worth showing, because conté
        is quite messy. It's coal, it gets all over your skin and your clothes and it smears and I had a mental
        block because of it. I wanted to stay clean, but after my first attempt turned out poorly I asked my instructor
        for some advice. Her answer: "Sometimes you just have to get messy." So that's what I did. I think it turned out well :)
