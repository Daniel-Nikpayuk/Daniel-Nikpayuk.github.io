        This <strong>installation</strong> was by far one of my favorite projects. It was a reminder to us that there
        was always a tension between art as <em>aesthetics</em> and art as <em>politics</em>&mdash;and therefore a social
        responsibility to consider whenever creating something new.

        I chose to show the shallow ways in which mainstream Canadian culture engages with my own Inuit culture.
        The point being the real need for empathy if we're ever going to reconcile as peoples. I demonstrated this
        shallow engagement by the contrast between the <em>idealized</em> cardboard inukshuk with a <em>living breathing
        on-going</em> adaptation of an inukshuk. The flags represented mainstream narratives of Inuit culture that
        would inevitably lead you to the idealized inukshuk instead of the real thing.
