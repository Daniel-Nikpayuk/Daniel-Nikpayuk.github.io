        This project was suppose to be a <strong>triptych</strong>. You might be asking: "Where are the other two paintings?"
        Good point. The first is in <em>black and white</em>. The second was suppose to be in <em>color</em>, and the third
        was in <em>the style of</em> (your favorite artist). Unfortunately this is the one project I didn't complete,
        and I don't have photos for the incomplete second and third paintings, though the third was in the style of
        <em>Norval Morrisseau</em>.

        The only other memorable thing worth mentioning is the technique used to create shadows in color: You use the
        <em>complementary</em> color, so if the object you're painting is orange, its shadow should be blue. That's
        pretty neat. Not something I would've figured out on my own.
