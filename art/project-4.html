      <p>
        This project we learned about <strong>perspective drawing</strong>. I've always been able to draw what
        I see in front of me pretty well, but it was nice learning techniques to improve accuracy of realism
        and of perception. I'll tell you what, drawing is very relaxing and calming. I knew it as a child,
        but was reminded of it here. I should do it more often.
