        I'm quite proud of this <strong>tonal portrait</strong>. We took selfies then were asked to draw the portrait
        and finally paint over the drawing. The portrait underneath was much more detailed and received a lot of praise.
        Unfortunately I didn't think to take a photo before painting over it.

        As for the project, I really liked learning how you could create lines through contrasts without actually drawing lines.
