      <p>
        This project was all about <strong>line weight</strong>. I actually had a hard time with the concept as it can be
        used to signify different things. This is to say, adding weight to a line was semantic in nature and open to
        interpretation. It was cultural. As an introduction, I had no frame of reference or real understanding of it.
        I've only realized the cultural and political nature of its use after the fact. It's good to know about though.
