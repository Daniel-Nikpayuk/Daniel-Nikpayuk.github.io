      <p>
        In this project we designed <strong>book covers</strong>. I didn't realize how much I would enjoy it.
        Out of the five projects in this course, this is the one I gave my heart to. I had former experience
        with typesetting from years of learning and using <em>LaTeX</em>, but I never realized just how much
        I loved <strong>typography</strong> in general.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were allowed to choose our own book as a start. I had recently received a Japanese copy of
        <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. I was learning Japanese at the time, and I figured the best way
        to continue my studies was to read a novel I was already familiar with in English.
        This is the original book cover:
      </p>

      <div class="design-image">
        <image src="images/project-5a.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover" class="center" style="width:50%"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        After choosing our book, we were asked to come up with our own jackets for it. I wanted to honor the spirit
        of the text and that of <em>Holden Caulfield</em> himself. He wouldn't want a <em>phony</em> book cover, you know?
        I designed two varieties of book cover with this in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the first, I started by reproducing the original as closely as possible:
      </p>

      <div class="design-image">
        <image src="images/project-5b.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        I was actually using <em>LaTeX</em> to do the typesetting, while using <em>asymptote</em> for the graphical
        manipulation of the text, not to mention in creating the outline of the border and folds of the jacket.
        The only downside to this approach is the lack of support for <em>unicode</em> in <em>LaTeX</em>.
        Because of this I didn't get to use an ideal font for the Japanese characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following this, I took a minimalist approach and added text from the book itself to extend the original design.
        The book was about life, the relationships that connect and bind us, and a coming of age. I tried to show this visually: 
      </p>

      <div class="design-image">
        <image src="images/project-5c.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        and although I didn't submit the following two alternatives, it wasn't difficult to play with color once
        the code was set up:
      </p>

      <div class="design-image">
        <image src="images/project-5d.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover"/>
        <image src="images/project-5e.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        The second jacket style I created was to have <em>no jacket at all</em>. Don't judge a book by its cover, you know?
        With that in mind, I took the first page of the book, copied it, and made it as the front of the jacket (Japanese
        reading style is actually top to bottom, right to left, so the front of a book is opposite to Western style books).
        Judge the merit of a book by its content, so just start with page one, no illusion, you know?
      </p>

        <image src="images/project-5f.jpg" alt="A photo of a book cover"/>
      </div>
