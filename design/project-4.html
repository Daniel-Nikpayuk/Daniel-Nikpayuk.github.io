        This project in designing <strong>magazine pages</strong> was a lot of fun. I didn't know about the industry
        use of <em>lorem ipsum</em> as filler for prototyping textual design and how there are online generators
        to create as much nonsense text as you'd like.

        I took the opportunity with this project to pay homage to my favorite cartoon: <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>.
        Keep in mind I distinguish between anime and cartoons as separate genres, so I choose not to compare this show
        to some of my favorite anime currently out there. Regardless, this show is great, you should check it out
        if you haven't, though that's neither here nor there :P
