          The majority of code presented in this section comes from my <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Nikpayuk/nik">nik library</a>
          which can be described as: <em>An independent C++ template library focused on the reimplementation of core STL data structures
          while maintaining a clean narrative design</em>. The basic design decisions that will help you navigate its code content
          are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>additivity</strong>: Branches are split up and indexed by hardware abstractions. For example there are narrative
            branches for memory, the screen, the keyboard etc.&mdash;but to emphasize the idea that these are abstractions the branches
            are given alternative names than their respective hardware types: <em>numeric, graphic, literic</em>, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>modularity</strong>: The modules within each branch are split up into <em>semiotic</em> and <em>media</em> modes.
            The difference being that media variants are meant for general users of the library with the implicit assumption that code
            in each mode is user-friendly and user-safe. Semiotic variants make no such assumptions, the code here is for the library
            architects: It is meant to be as reusable as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>composability</strong>: Within semiotic modes, structure and function are kept independent and are only combined
            (adhering to the object oriented paradigm) within media modules. This allows for greater composability of
            <em>structure with structure</em>, and <em>function with function</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>optimization</strong>: The above design decisions are the default but may be deviated from during implementation
            if a strong enough optimization is justified.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>May 3, 2018</h4>

        <p>
          Many if not most classes in <em>nik</em> are modelled as algebraic data types, meaning they are constructed
          from <em>coproducts</em> and <em>products</em>. Bartosz Milewski
          <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">points out</a>
          that although coproducts have no formal grammar in C++ they can still be interpreted within the language.
          Most notably, they show up as the disjoint union of overloaded constructors within a single class definition.
        </p>

        <p>
          The intentions of my library differ slightly, and as consequence so does my model: To build an axiomatic narrative
          for data structure construction, I choose to interpret <em>raw pointers</em> as coproducts. For example, if you were
          to iterate over a linked list, effectively you're iterating over the pointers of its nodes. And even though these
          nodes exist concurrently in memory, they are accessed sequentially, meaning you can only look at them one at
          a time (hence the iteration). As such, you can view these nodes as the runtime disjoint union of alternatives:
          The interpretation then is that pointers themselves are runtime coproducts.
        </p>

        <h2>read_type</h2>
        <h4>May 4, 2018</h4>

        <p>
          From the experience of past projects I have included a <em>read_type</em> template class in the global definitions of
          my library. This class has no runtime consequences, it's entirely overhead for maintaining type safety as an alternative
          to using the <strong>const</strong> keyword in regards to pointer definitions. Intuitively, you give it a <em>Type</em>,
          and it either adds or removes the <em>const</em> accordingly, taking special care when that type is a pointer <em>Type*</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main application of such meta-programming comes when defining <em>iterators, const_iterators</em>.
          In practice such iterators tend to have nearly identical definitions with the exception of a few <em>const</em>
          placements, and as <em>const</em> is entirely a compile time type safety consideration, it makes sense to handle
          it in this way. The alternative is to define separate cases for each iterator which is unnecessarily redundant.
        </p>

        <h2>copair</h2>
        <h4>May 4, 2018</h4>

        <p>
          With some foresight regarding the larger narrative design of this library, I have included as part of the definitions a pair
          of coproducts&mdash;aptly named <em>copair</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coproducts are used to define iterators, a construct already common in C++. On the other hand, until recently the idea of
          <strong>ranges</strong>&mdash;which already show up in many other languages&mdash;was underutilized. Copairs will be used
          to define such ranges in this library. Conceptually they parallel iterators, and as such they will be refered to as
          <em>selectors</em>. This particular name derives from the ubiquitous digital utility of <em>text selection</em>.
        </p>

      <div class="anchor" id="product"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>product</h2>
        <h4>May 4, 2018</h4>

        <p>
          As mentioned with <em>coproducts</em>, many if not most classes in <em>nik</em> are modelled as algebraic data types,
          meaning <em>products</em> are also a fundamental grammatical construct within this library.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a coproduct is interpreted as the <strong>sequential union</strong> of instances of a type, then a product is the
          <strong>concurrent union</strong> of such instances. Granted, these are narrower definitions of <em>coproducts, products</em>
          than the full category theoretic varieties, but it is our intention to take an interpretation which aligns well with the
          idea of a <em>register machine</em>, and which aligns well with the grammar of C++ itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Concurrent memory requires an array, as such our product as type is implemented as one of fixed length. We might be
          tempted to build into this low-level definition a more powerful dynamic length array, but the overarching narrative
          of this library is that all data structures are fundamentally implemented as trees, which are themselves decomposed
          into fixed length arrays. For a given data structure, there's no assumption its size will change, on the other hand
          it's easy enough to define equipment for these products to actively vary the length of such memory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, even though the memory of products is concurrent, the assumption is that access to each product component
          is still sequential, meaning we need ways of expressing and navigating product substructures. In this class we
          declare iterators and selectors to do just this.
        </p>

      <p>
        As the design of this library can be somewhat involved for the uninitiated I offer here a quick tour of its paradigms,
        starting with general specifications:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It is intended primarily to be a template library, prioritizing an axiomatic style of code reuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its main modules are tethered to hardware concepts. For example the <em>numeric</em> module is meant
          to represent the various levels of hardware memory, while the <em>graphic</em> module (not yet implemented)
          would focus on interfacing with hardware screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          The narrative design takes the perspective of algebraic data types, while still retaining the context of C++ grammar.
          In particular this means the basic building blocks for all other classes are <em>coproduct</em> and <em>product</em>.
          This terminology comes from category theory. The explanation of these classes are given below.
        </li>
        <li>
          The numeric module builds the following classes: <em>bit, word, address, tree</em>. The idea is every other possible
          data structure of interest is fundamentally (and efficiently) built from these types, and as they are numeric in
          content, they are also implicitly generic. This means they can be intepreted and reinterpreted to represent
          all other possible types as well.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The above is paralleled by implementation design:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Every class can be said to have two variants known as <em>semiotic</em> and <em>media</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Semiotic classes are designed to be minimalist, clean, composable, reusable, with no expectation of safety.
          This level is meant to be used by the library architect, to efficiently build the media classes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Media classes are designed to be user-friendly and safe, and are meant to be used by general library users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Semiotic classes will by default keep their methods separated as static functions for greater reusability.
        </li>
        <li> 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p>
          After a much needed <em>long break</em> from C++, I think I'd like to return.
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of my time away was to immerse myself in <strong>functional programming</strong>. In particular,
          I've spent more time with category theory as well as type theory, learning about denotational semantics,
          and what these theories have to offer&mdash;not to mention how I can apply them to imperative paradigms
          so that I could become a better C++ programmer in general. When I left, I felt I had somewhat
          plateaued in all honesty.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, I recently rediscovered the following videos for two apps I must've written a good 7-8 years ago:
        </p>

        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
         <source src="cpp/flashcards.mp4" type="video/mp4">
         Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
         <source src="cpp/piano.mp4" type="video/mp4">
         Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <p>
          I wrote them in <strong>Qt v4.8.3</strong>, which at the time was the start of and transition into <strong>Qml</strong>
          and Qt 5. My <em>flashcards app</em> in particular I'm proud of (the above video might not do it justice), at the
          same time though it was never completely finished either. I came very close. I was comfortable with Qt and C++,
          but I wasn't strong enough as a <em>designer</em> or <em>engineer</em> and I knew it. I made it as far as I did
          in coding these apps based entirely off my math training, but I knew if I didn't get better at design thinking
          (which I claim is broader than math thinking) it would hinder me in the long run.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I plan on making many apps and general software in the future&mdash;not to mention finishing my <em>nik</em>
          library&mdash;I'm willing to say it was worth putting these projects on hold until I became a better designer.
          Since then, I've committed these last 7-8 years to learning how to be one, and have even innovated my own
          paradigms and narratives when it comes to interface design. I look at these unfinished apps, and I'm ready
          to return with a stronger skillset and see what kind of difference it makes. I look forward to it.

          <h3>April 24, 2017</h3>
        </header>

        <p>
          I've decided to take a short break from all my C++ stuff for a little while.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few reasons. One of the biggest motivating factors though is in discovering a really thoughtful
          template library called <a href="https://github.com/odinthenerd/brigand">brigand</a> written by Odin Holmes et al.
          This library does much of what I've been trying to do in the <em>grammaric</em> module of my <em>nik</em> library,
          but when it comes to speed optimization it does it much better. It's given me a lot to think about.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certainly I'd like to adopt some of the optimization wisdoms I've found in brigand&mdash;there is some overlap&mdash;yet
          at the same time I also recognize we have differing goals to begin with. Brigand is meant to scale for template
          meta programming, while my own module is meant to be used throughout my larger <em>nik</em> library,
          which shouldn't necessarily require such extreme efficiencies (and thus should not require the sometimes
          overly complicated level of implementation code you'd find in brigand).
        </p>

        <p>
          Basically, I've learned a few new ways of thinking about template meta programming which makes me look back at
          all I've been doing, and I know I need to integrate these new tools, but I don't yet know how best. One example
          worth mentioning is the <strong>template template</strong> grammar:
        </p>

        <image src="cpp/template-template.png" alt="Image of template template code" class="center" style="width:50%">

        <p>
          I've been doing things this whole time without even knowing this very important grammar point. I can rewrite
          and simplify so much of my existing code now with this, but it also introduces new narrative design decisions
          and in the short term complicates things. I'll have to sit and wait on it, all the more reason to take a break.
        </p>

        <p>&mdash;</p>

        <p>
          The other reason I'm deciding to take a break is due to the most recent design manifesto I've written regarding
          <a href="https://daniel-nikpayuk.github.io/manifestos/concept-theory.html">concept theory</a>. I've known for
          a while now that I wanted to make my own programming language, but with this manifesto I now know I have the
          skeleton model necessary to do it. It also occurred to me the design of my <em>nik</em> library is slowly
          converging toward this programming language, so it makes sense to work on it for a while: The more I have
          figured out, the clear my design goals become for my <em>nik</em> library as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, I've been focused on my own designs for a while now, and although I feel this is important and have no
          regrets, I also think it's important to learn other theories and other ways, to upgrade my skillset so to speak.
          It is for all these reasons I will be taking a bit of a break from C++, though I hope to return with some new skills,
          and a refreshed motivation.

        <p>
          I haven't posted anything new in C++ in a little while. I thought I'd update my current line of thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was stuck at a point of <em>modular divergence</em> in some design decisions regarding my <em>nik</em> library:
          As my <em>grammaric</em> module has expanded, I've needed to set some clear specification designs regarding the
          overall grammar. The problem that has come up is in the contrast between <strong>lazy</strong> as well as
          <strong>strict</strong> evaluation. I have come to realize I need both, and I need to be able to code for either.
          The best solution I can think of to allow for both is to default to one variety (lazy seems most appropriate)
          then offer grammar that allows the low-level coder to override when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tend to slow down when it comes to making large design decisions. I'm impatient to move the design forward,
          but experience has taught me that you have to sit and really think it over or risk rewriting lots of code
          down the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an extension of this, it occurred to me it also makes sense as part of the narrative design to expand my
          <em>grammaric</em> module to work its way up toward a full out <strong>LISP</strong> style evaluator.
          I mean this template meta programming is functional to begin with. Not only would this be useful in its own
          right, but it would give me practice at actually implementing metacircular evaluators and the likes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I take my inspiration from the
          <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1">metacircular evaluator</a>
          presented in
          <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>
          (SICP). It offers enough detail to be a skeletal roadmap. The problem that arises here, is I have to ask the question:
          Is it actually worth it? In a learning sense, for my own benefit, it definitely is, but will it actually contribute
          to the design of my library? It's enough of a time commitment on its own I need to think it through.
        </p>

        <p>
          Things have stalled because I have more questions than answers right now. Maybe it means it's time to take a break,
          work on one of my many other projects for a while and come back to this with fresh eyes. This was always intended
          to be a multiyear project after all.

          Why bother? I've created compile-time control flow logic for my <em>nik</em> library in which this template control
          flow logic is most effective using lazy evaluation. As part of this, not only is it desirable to lazy "evaluate" template
          parameter types, but compile type constants as well. As such, it's more appropriate to express any such derived constants
          as applicative which then only evaluates if actually called.

          An example of my <em>nik</em> library grammar in action. This function takes an array (out, length)
          and resizes it (n) putting the new memory <em>before</em>:

          Its implementation is a special case of my batch-map operator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having declared a <em>tmp</em> pointer, we create an <em>assign</em> adverb. We specify our pointer-as-subject to be
          allocated with size <em>length+n</em> and offset starting at position <em>n</em> (new memory "before"). We specify our
          pointer-as-object to be deallocated communicating the <em>origin</em> (needed for array deallocation) to our instance.
          We call <strong>map</strong> with <em>tmp</em>-as-subject and [<em>origin, origin+length</em>) as range as-object.
          Here <strong>map</strong> copy-assigns the range to <em>tmp</em> from its offset passing <em>allocate, deallocate</em>;
          <strong>map</strong> also knows to allocate <em>tmp</em> as array and deallocate <em>origin</em> after copy-assign.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally we reset <em>origin</em> (currently dangling) to <em>tmp</em>. <strong>Q</strong>: If we deallocate,
          why specify <em>origin</em> if it's being passed anyway? It might seem redundant but it's not. The range-as-object
          may cover only part of the object array for the actual map operation. As such you need to independently specify the origin.
          We can't assume such info will be passed in the range.
        </p>

        <p>
          Admittedly the many <em>typename</em> as well as <em>template</em> keywords make it seem complicated,
          but otherwise this style is shaping up rather well. Well, that's it for now. Thanks.

          I'm still looking to reduce <em>template instantiation code bloat</em>. This time out I've come up with some proof of concept
          code for what I'm calling <strong>polymorphic dispatching</strong>:
        </p>

        <image src="cpp/polymorphic-dispatch-1.png" alt="Image of polymorphic dispatch code">

        <p>
          here we have two variant functions which dispatch by type. They're set up to be run-time polymorphic as pointer input.
          Next we have four variant functions which dispatch by an extended type but also call the previous function as well.
        </p>

        <image src="cpp/polymorphic-dispatch-2.png" alt="Image of polymorphic dispatch code">

        <p>
          in this case our 4 variants take their dispatch-adverb by reference. Why not pass directly to the called function as well?
          because template instantiation would create 4 versions of the called function (square) instead of 2&mdash;the compiler might
          not realize this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we test to see if the compiler (gcc) even accepts this grammar:

        <image src="cpp/polymorphic-dispatch-3.png" alt="Image of polymorphic dispatch code">

        <p>
          admittedly I've only tested two of the four functions here. In any case here are the results:

          It's an artificial example but <em>proof of concept</em> is after all to see if a paradigm and its implementation grammar
          work in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any solution is better than none, but I'm still looking at alternatives. I've used run-time (dynamic) polymorphism here.
          it uses a virtual lookup table and has potential for cache misses. The main alternate would be compile-time polymorphism.
          that's what I'm researching now. I have a proof, but I'm not satisfied (too messy, doesn't scale well). Just keep trying
          is all.

          This is all part of my <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Nikpayuk/nik">nik</a> library.
          Here we have basic test cases for each operator:

          Engineers emphasize modularity, extensibility, additivity. As a mathematician, I would add the need for axiomatic

          This is an example of a <em>dispatch</em> of my C++ batch-map operator. It's ugly in its own way,

          I broke taboo and used macros to hide the complexity of parameter &amp; argument type. I also broke efficiency taboo by
          calling functions within a loop. As I've stated previously, I have modularized a <em>prototype</em> version from an
          inlined <em>specialize</em> version.

          Sometimes I feel C++ needs a way to compile-time build functions so I don't need to resort to this. The feature
          I'm most proud of is how a language like C++ lets you modularize structure from type. For example this map takes
          untyped pointers as input (list begin/end), but also independently takes type info (as adjective) about it.
          Hard to explain why that's good, but it is. It provides an elegant flexibility and makes it very reusable :)

        <p>
          With variadic templating I use templates as namespace modules. I also parallel linguistic grammar to free-form construct
          <em>adjectives</em> and <em>adverbs</em>. I've set up the interface to be user-friendly in that when specifying
          <em>associations/connotations</em> (traits/policies) one need not worry about order or completion (defaults are provided)
          with the setup, I now create a basic array [0..4] and use a lambda as function to pass to the <em>list-map</em> operator:

          I admit it's quite complicated looking to do something so simple&mdash;especially compared to functional languages which
          have the map operator built in. And even in standard C++, there are quicker ways to express the result, but it's not about
          that. The real work in what's hidden underneath the grammar interface. I have 9216 map variants (not including the function
          pass), all of which follow a clean efficient design, which will be reused in so much else within the library I'm building.

          I've been coding in C++ for almost 10 years now. The first years were just getting comfortable with the various
          grammar constructs and the overall expressivity of the language. These following years&mdash;now that I'm comfortable
          with the grammar&mdash;have been more about <em>design thinking</em>: Paradigms, and other computational ways of thinking
          that are broader than any given language.

          Recently though, I've reached a sort of <em>ceiling</em> where to really get better at optimizations, I needed to

          in <strong>haskell</strong>. Sweet! :)
