          As a coder, when working independently I prefer to use the <strong>vim</strong> text-editor
          (Don't worry, I'm not here to start any tribal wars).
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to facilitate calling various compilers and whatnot from vim I also tend to rely on <strong>bash scripts</strong>.
          I thought I'd share a few of them here. Keep in mind they're nothing spectacular, and if they existed for any other reason
          than personal use I'd make them more robust, but they might still be of interest to newer bash coders.

        <p>
          I'm frequently writing <em>LaTeX</em> articles. When editing, I'm compiling and recompiling the source often
          to see what it looks like visually. I prefer to build pdf documents. Anyway, as it gets tedious to call each
          command directly, I wrote a script instead:
        </p>

        <image src="bash/pdflatex.png" alt="Image of pdflatex script" style="width:70%">

        <ol>
          <li>
            This script is only meant to work with one ".tex" file in a directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the user offers a name, it's accepted, otherwise the single file from the directory is deduced.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is verified that exactly one latex file exists. If there's zero or more than one the script halts.
          </li>
          <li>
            I run <strong>pdflatex</strong>, then as I frequently use the <strong>asymptote</strong> programming
            language in conjunction (as a latex package), I check to see if any ".asy" files were generated.
            If they were, I compile them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I run pdflatex again. If I have hyperlink references embedded, or I need to update bibliographic info,
            or if I was in fact using asymptote, I would need to run pdflatex a second time anyway.
            If not, then I have run it a second time for nothing, which isn't great, but not the worst offense
            either. If it really mattered, it would be easy enough to modify the script to add the option to
            prevent double compiling.
          </li>
          <li>
            If everything compiled properly, a ".pdf" file will exist. If not, it won't. I can use this
            property of the pdflatex compiler to test whether or not I should run <strong>evince</strong>
            (the supported pdf viewer on my operating system) to view the output.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>January 12, 2017</h4>

        <p>
          As my main personal project is a C++ library, I'm frequently compiling and testing code. It gets tedious
          to call each command directly, so this is my shortform:
        </p>

        <image src="bash/cpp-compile.png" alt="Image of cpp-compile script" style="width:80%">

        <ol>
          <li>
            I get the working directory by removing the longest pathname prefix ending in "/".
          </li>
          <li>
            I then get the name the user wants for the compiled (executable) file. If the user does not supply
            a name, I use the working directory name as default.
          </li>
          <li>
            I call gcc or g++ depending on the source "main" file, printing the compiler output both to the screen
            and to an error file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assuming the file compiled, I execute its code as well as return its basic runtime statistics.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <div class="anchor" id="copyright-update"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>copyright update</h2>
        <h4>January 2, 2017</h4>

        <p>
          Every coder has their own copyright update script I'm sure, this is mine.
        </p>

        <image src="bash/copyright-update.png" alt="Image of copyright update script" style="width:70%">

        <ol>
          <li>
            I call <strong>find</strong> with a <em>regular expression</em>
            matching C++ filename extensions returning the names (and paths) of C++ files.
          </li>
          <li>
            I then feed this list into the <em>while</em> loop construct where I modify the copyrights.
          </li>
          <li>
            I use a <strong>mawk</strong> script for the text substitutions themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            The modified file is saved as <em>tmp.txt</em>, and then renamed to replace the original.
            As such, this script assumes none of the directories you're working in have a file called <em>tmp.txt</em>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The nice thing about the commandline is it literally takes 2-3 seconds to update hundreds of text files :)
