          My introduction to <strong>R</strong> was actually a one month long mooc. I had enough experience in general coding,
          plus I had recently familiarized myself with functional programming through the classic text
          <a href="../readings/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>
          that I was able to fill in the blanks when it came to writing effective code&mdash;though certainly I had a lot of dictionary
          style referencing to do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following this, I have taken on a few data science projects close to my heart. I offer some of them here.

        <h2>Canadian Political Party Financials - Comparative Transparency Report (CPPF-CTR)</h2>
        <h4>August 5, 2015</h4>

        <p>
          In anticipation of the <em>2015 Canadian Federal Election</em>, A local politician asked me to perform a comparative
          analysis of Canadian political party financial successes. In particular, I was asked to look at how well the various
          parties over the years have balanced their budgets:
        </p>

        <p>
          I took on this project with dedication and enthusiasm as it was a nice way to gain further experience in the area
          of data science. It also gave me real world experience in using <strong>R</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>
          which I feel is always better than the artificial practice you'd get in a course. It was completely open ended
          with no guidance whatsoever. I had to not only find the appropriate data sets, I had to use them to build my
          own so I could analyze and interpret the results. <em>It was a lot of fun</em>. I could get into this kind
          of work I think.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, as I've already written up the findings elsewhere, I'll refer you to the full report
          <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Nikpayuk/CPPF-CTR">here</a>.

        <h2>First Nations Financial Transparency Act (FNFTA)</h2>
        <h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

        <p>
          As an independent project, I decided to build a comparative data set with the information provided by the
          First Nations Financial Transparency Act. Doing so would allow First Nations (Native Americans) in Canada
          to counter&mdash;with hard evidence&mdash;unfortunate mainstream narratives of First Nations' governmental corruption.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am Inuit myself, so this Federal Act does not apply to my people, but as Indigenous folk in Canada,
          we still share many of the same social problems: It's good to help each other out where we can. This
          project also gave me the opportunity to grow my skills in statistics and in using the <strong>R</strong>
          programming language:
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only did I convert and clean many smaller independent data sets, I accumulated them into a large
          one in which I could perform the appropriate analysis. This comparative data set also allowed me to
          analyze auxiliary considerations like the distribution of accounting firms chosen to audit the original
          reports:
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm quite proud of my report. I put in a lot of effort to thoroughly document the whole process.
          Under normal circumstances this might be considered overkill, but I wanted to develop as many best
          practices as I could, so as to learn as much as possible to make it easier in the future
          when I take on other similar data science projects. You can see the full report
