        <h2>Concept Theory: A paradigm for navigation design</h2>
        <h3>April 14th, 2017</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Manifest Statement</strong>: <em>Computational Programming as a discipline deserves a theoretical inventory
          of navigably complex spaces which allow for the expressions, manipulations, and solutions to its computational problems.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The interpretation of a <strong>navigably complex space</strong> is unpacked as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>navigably complex</strong>: There is a density of elements, subspaces, objects, structures, types,
            for which to navigate, as well as a rich variety of ways to navigate this density.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>navigably computable</strong>: The navigational interface&mdash;the means to navigating to the elements,
            subspaces, etc.&mdash;is effectively computable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>navigably expressive</strong>: The navigational interface is a flexible and accessible namespace
            for referring to the elements, subspaces, etc.~within.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          A space such as this is <em>highly navigable</em>, and allows us to optimize <em>the generality-specificity trade off</em>
          within predicate logic. It acts as the infrastructure for designing and interpreting detailed models within many different
          and diverse contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
          I assert this unpacked interpretation is not absurd, and demonstrate its existence with a template implementation
          of a navigably complex space. I show its narrative focus to be that of <em>namespaces</em>, and proclaim as its
          <strong>guiding principle</strong>: <em>That which cannot be named cannot be accessed.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Namespaces</h2>

        <p>
          The idea of a <strong>navigably complex namespace</strong> is as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            We choose to mitigate the inherent complexity of this space. We do so by stratifying it into layers of names.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower layers of names are used to construct higher layers of names.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower layers have names possessing increased constructive entropy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Higher layers have names possessing decreased constructive entropy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Names which are completely determined have zero entropic ability, and are known as <strong>types</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The act of resolving a name for translation into another namespace is known as <strong>identity resolution</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          As we use names in a <em>referential</em> sense, I submit that a referential name has higher entropy when it has
          a higher ability to delay its reference. The state of a delayed referral is known as a <strong>deferral</strong>,
          as such a delayed name is a deferred name. I declare that a navigably complex space of deferred names is the
          <strong>concept space</strong> we seek.
        </p>

        <p>
          I invoke the <strong>Curry-Howard Isomorphism</strong> as analogy to offer the following claim: A concept space
          is isomorphic to a given model of specification semantics. This model of specification semantics states that
          a specification acts as a semantic filter. Weak specifications lead to stronger specifications, but can still
          have their own algebras. A classical example in mathematics is the definition of a <em>limit</em> in calculus.
          It is constructed from weaker topological specifications, which are used to define and prove its algebra.
          As a filter it applies to many functions and sequences, but can be narrowed further to effective contextual
          instances during application.
        </p>

        <p>
          The isomorphism exists between concepts and filters, offering dual ways to express, manipulate,
          and solve computational problems. I offer a three part article giving an exact example of a concept space:
