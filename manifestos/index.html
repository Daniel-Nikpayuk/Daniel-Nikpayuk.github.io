        This first list of manifestos offers general paradigms of computational design, which in theory are applicable
        to all available contexts. Formally they can be read independently, but informally they build on each other.

        This second list of manifestos offers narratives of computational design, still broad and applicable to many
        contexts, but far more focused toward languages. As with the previous list, they can be read independently,
        but in this case, they do make use of the paradigms within the first list.
